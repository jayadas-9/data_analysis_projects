In this mini-project, I performed tasks such as web scraping, extracting and cleaning data along with visualizing the data. The data that was used was the Quarterly revenue of the Tesla stocks and GameStop stocks. The data was scraped from https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts for different stocks, cleaned using python libraries.  A picture is worth 1,000 words, so to understand the concept better I created visualizations of the stock history and growth over a period of time.
